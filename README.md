# TutoTool
This program is part of the Project Management course evaluation.

TutoTool is a program desing to help academic tutors, mainly from the computer science school at BUAP, to extract information from students
cardex. The way tutors do such task is by selecting the student pdf file and then pick the needed information by selecting, copying and 
pasting to an Excel file and repeat that process for the entire seccion of students. The main goal of the tutors is to create charts and databases 
in Excel.

What TutoTools aims for is to automate the information extracting by letting the tutor choose a pdf file and, from a checkbox selection, 
pick the requiered information for then  create a xls file.
